## Chapter 21: Electric charge and electric field

1. Coulomb's Law:
   - folmula: $$ F = { { k q_1 q_2} \over { r^2 }} = { { q_1 q_2 } \over { 4 \pi { \epsilon }_0  r^2 } } $$

2. four properites of electric force
   - the universe is electrically neutral on large scales
   - Electric force is very strongï¼Œ 36 orders of magnitude stronger than gravitational force.
   - Electric charge has polarity and can be shielded (screened)
   - The charges distribution can be polarized

3. electric field of a point charge
   - $$ \overrightarrow{E} ={ { 1 \over { { 4 \pi\epsilon_0 } } }  { q \over r^2 } } \overrightarrow{r} $$
   - electirc field pattern
     - point charge: a positive point charge points away from the charge <br>

   - dipole<br>

## Chapter 22: Gauss's law

1. Gauss's law
   - electric flux
      - The net electric flux is directly proportional to the net amount of charge enclosed within the surface.
      - The net electric flux is independent of the size of the closed surface.
      - formula: $$ \phi_E = \overrightarrow{E} \overrightarrow{A} = E A (point product) $$
      - In general, the flux through a surface must be computed using a surface integral over the area:<br>
         ![surface integral](Assets/imgs/chap22_1.png)
      - electric flux is the same for both areas and is independent of the radius of the sphere and depends only on the charge inside
      - general form of Gauss's law<br>
         ![applications of Gauss's law](Assets/imgs/chap22_2.png)
      - Gauss's law in terms of derivatives<br>
         ![Gauss's law in terms of derivatives](Assets/imgs/chap22_3.png)
         <br>the triangle symbol in the above formula means the unit vector with direction perpenticular to the surface.

## Chapter 23: Electric Potential

1. Electric potential energy of two point charges <br>
![electric potential energy of two charge points](Assets/imgs/chap23_1.png)<br>

   - potential of *a* w.r.t. *b* $$V_ab = V_a - V_b$$ equals the work done by the eletric forve when a *unit* charge moves from *a* to *b*

## chapter 24: Capacitance and Dielectrics

1. capacitance:
   - SI unit: $$ 1 F = 1 C/V = 1 c^2 / N = 1 C^2 = J $$
   - capacitor: Any two conductors separated by an insulator (or a vacuum) form a capacitor
     - when the capacitor is charged, it means the two conductors have charges with equal magnitude and opposite sign, and the net charge on the capacitor as a whole is zero.
     - capacitance C
       - $$ C = { Q \over V_{ab} } = \epsilon_0 { A \over d } $$
       - If we change the magnitude of charge on each conductor, the potential difference between conductors changes; however, the ratio of charge to potential difference does not change
     - parallel-plate capacitor
       - capacitor consists of two parallel conducting plates separated by a distance that is small compared to their dimensions <br>
     - energy stored in a capacitor
       ![energy stored in a capacitor](Assets/imgs/chap24_2.png)
       - formula derivation
         ![derivation 1](Assets/imgs/chap24_3.png)
         ![derivation 2](Assets/imgs/chap24_4.png)
     - capacitor in series
       When several capacitors are connected in series, the **magnitude of charge is the same** on all plates of all the capacitors.
       ![capacitor in series](Assets/imgs/chap24_5.png)
     - capacitor in parallel
       Capacitors are connected in parallel between a and b if the **potential difference** $$ V_ab $$ is the same for all the capacitors. 
       ![capacitor in parallel](Assets/imgs/chap24_5.png)
     - applications
       - calculating the torque on a variable capacitor
         ![calculating the torque](Assets/imgs/chap24_7.png)

       - spherical capacitor
         Notice that we need to find the electric V using integral of E dx and could not using the formula of electric potential of point charge because of different electric field E
         ![spherical capcacitor](Assets/imgs/chap24_8.png)
         ![cylindrical capacitor](Assets/imgs/chap24_9.png)

2. capacity with dielectrics
   - Electric Polarization
      ![Electric Polarization](Assets/imgs/chap24_10.png)
   - calculate the electric field
      ![electric field inside dielectrics](Assets/imgs/chap24_11.png)
      ![capacitor](Assets/imgs/chap24_12.png)
   - summary
      ![summary](Assets/imgs/chap24_13.png)
   - dielectic constant
      ![dielectic constant](Assets/imgs/chap24_14.png)
   - dielectric breakdown
      - If the electric field is strong enough, dielectric breakdown occurs and the dielectric becomes a conductor
      - The dielectric strength is the maximum electric field the material can withstand before breakdown occurs.
      - force on a dielectric thin film
       ![force on a dielectric thin film](Assets/imgs/chap24_15.png)
       <br>above formula of $$ F_x $$ actually applies that $$ W = { {V^2 C} \over  2} $$

## chapter 25: Current, Resistance, and Electromotive Force

1. current
   - A current is any motion of charge from one region to another
   ![current](Assets/imgs/chap25_1.png)
   - conventional current is treated as a flow of positive charges
   - current density
   ![current density](Assets/imgs/chap25_2.png)
   - resistivity
   ![resistivity](Assets/imgs/chap25_3.png)
   - resistance

   $$ R = { {\rho L} \over A } $$
   - Ohm's law
   $$ V = I R $$
   - resistivity within small range of temperature
   ![resistivity within small range of temperature](Assets/imgs/chap25_4.png)

2. electromotive force (emf)
