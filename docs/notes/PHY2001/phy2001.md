## Chapter 21: Electric charge and electric field

1. Coulomb's Law:
   - folmula: $$ F = { { k q_1 q_2} \over { r^2 }} = { { q_1 q_2 } \over { 4 \pi { \epsilon }_0  r^2 } } $$

2. four properites of electric force
   - the universe is electrically neutral on large scales
   - Electric force is very strongï¼Œ 36 orders of magnitude stronger than gravitational force.
   - Electric charge has polarity and can be shielded (screened)
   - The charges distribution can be polarized

3. electric field of a point charge
   - $$ \overrightarrow{E} ={ { 1 \over { { 4 \pi\epsilon_0 } } }  { q \over r^2 } } \overrightarrow{r} $$
   - electirc field pattern
     - point charge: a positive point charge points away from the charge <br>

## Chapter 22: Gauss's law

1. Gauss's law
   - electric flux
      - The net electric flux is directly proportional to the net amount of charge enclosed within the surface.
      - The net electric flux is independent of the size of the closed surface.
      - formula: $$ \phi_E = \overrightarrow{E} \overrightarrow{A} = E A (point product) $$
      - In general, the flux through a surface must be computed using a surface integral over the area:<br>
         ![surface integral](Assets/imgs/chap22_1.png)
      - electric flux is the same for both areas and is independent of the radius of the sphere and depends only on the charge inside
      - general form of Gauss's law<br>

      - Gauss's law in terms of derivatives<br>

## Chapter 23: Electric Potential

1. Electric potential energy of two point charges <br>
![electric potential energy of two charge points](Assets/imgs/chap23_1.png)<br>

   - potential of *a* w.r.t. *b* $$V_ab = V_a - V_b$$ equals the work done by the eletric forve when a *unit* charge moves from *a* to *b*
