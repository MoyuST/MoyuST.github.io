## part 1

1. a fluid is a substance that deforms continuously under a shear force of any magnitude

2. Fluids as a continuum
    • We know that fluids are made up of discrete components, i.e. atoms
    or molecules, with empty space in between.
    • However, in fluid mechanics we assume that a fluid is **a continuum i.e. the matter continuously fills all the space it occupies**.
    • This assumption is valid for most length scales

3. Liquids and gases
   Gas is compresible while liquid always remained almost same volume

4. properties of fluids
    - size
    - volume and flowrate
    - speed and velocity
    - pressure
      - $P={{F}\over{A}}$
      - $P={{dF}\over{dA}}$
      - Unit $Pa=N/m^2$
        <br>
      ![units of pressure](Assets/imgs/cha1_1.png)
      - $gauge pressure = Absolute pressure - Local atmospheric pressrue$
    - density
      - $\rho = {{m}\over{V}}$
      - Specific volume: $v={{V}\over{m}}={{1}\over{}}$
      - Specific gravity: $SG={{\rho}\over{\rho_H2O@4C}}={{\rho}\over{1000kg/m^3}}$
    - stress
      - tensile stress(pulled) vs. compressive stress(squeezed)
      - $stress={{F}\over{A}}$ where A is a cross-section area
    - shear stress
      - **opposing** forces that are not aligned
      - $\tau={{F}\over{A}}$
    - viscosity
      - laminar flow
        ![laminar flow](Assets/imgs/cha1_2.png)
        <br>
        $strain rate = {{du}\over{dy}}$
        <br>
        $\tau=\mu{{du}\over{dy}}$ with SI unit $Pa.s$
      - Newtonian fluids
        fluids with ${\tau \propto {{du}\over{dy}}}$
        - non-Newtonian fluids
         ![non-newtonian fluids](Assets/imgs/cha1_3.png)
         <br>
      - Viscosity is very sensitive to temperature.
         - Liquid viscosities usually decrease with increasing temperature.
         - Gas viscosities usually increase with increasing temperature.
      - Kinematic viscosity (dynamic viscosity)
        - $\nu={{\mu}\over{\rho}}$
      - Surface tension
        ![surface tension](Assets/imgs/cha1_4.png)
        - Surface tension decreases as temperature rises(surfactants)
        - Hydrophillic (low contact angle) vs. Hydrophobic (high contact angle)
        - Capillary effect
          ![Capillary effect of glass and water](Assets/imgs/cha1_5.png)
          <br>
          ![Capillary effect with mercury and water](Assets/imgs/cha1_6.png)
      - Ideal gas law
        - $PV=nRT$
          where *P* is the absolute pressure (Pa)
          *n* is the number of moles
          *R* is the universal gas constant, 8.314 J/K.mol
          *T* is the absolute temperature (i.e. in Kelvin)
        - $\rho={{PM}\over{RT}}$ since $\rho={{nM}\over{V}}$
